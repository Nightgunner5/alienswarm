[Alien Swarm](http://store.steampowered.com/app/630/) is a free game
made by Valve Software. Its gameplay is top-down cooperative for up
to four players. The source code is available through the free SDK
on Steam.

The files in the `vanilla` branch are the sole property of Valve
Software, but they're nice people so you can use them however you
like. The changes in the `patched` branch are in the public domain,
but I'd prefer you include some reference to this project if you use
them in your own project.

If you use these patches, I'd love to hear about it!
